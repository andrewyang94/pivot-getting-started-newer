<h1 align="center">Atoti Spring Boot Template</h1>
<p align="center">A minimalist Atoti project built with Spring Boot for you to edit, customize and use as a base for your Atoti Java projects.</p>

---

## üìã Details

This project aims to be an example of how to run Atoti as a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot)
application. Atoti was already a *Spring* application, but with the power of *Spring Boot* we can simplify our
dependency management, deployment model, and many other goodies that come with Spring Boot.

This project is a starting point for your own projects and implementations. You should be able to take this, customize
it and get a cube up and running in a few minutes.

## üì¶ Installation

#### Requirements

- Java 21
- Maven 3
- Atoti jar files (commercial software)
- Running the application requires a license for the Atoti software.

First, clone or download this repository.

Make sure to set your artifactory credentials in the maven `settings.xml`:

```xml
<servers>
    <server>
        <id>ActiveViamInternalRepository</id>
        <username>aya</username>
        <password>API_TOKEN</password>
    </server>
</servers>
```

Then, run `mvn clean install`. This will generate a jar file in the `target` folder, which can be run using
standard java commands.

**Note:** If your build is unsuccessful, try skipping tests: `mvn clean install -DskipTests`

## üíª Usage

### Running the fat jar

The project contains, out of the box, an extremely simple datastore schema and small `trades.csv` file. You can find
this file in `src/main/resources/data`.<br>

### Running on macOS

Add the following
argument `-Dactiveviam.chunkAllocatorKey=mmap` to your JVM, so it then becomes:

```bash
java -Dactiveviam.chunkAllocatorKey=mmap -Dfile.trades=<absolute path of trades.csv> -jar <absolute path of fat jar path>
```

**Note:** If unable to start the Atoti Spring Boot application, you may need to add some additional VM arguments as
well, try the following:

```bash
java --add-opens java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.net=ALL-UNNAMED -Dactiveviam.chunkAllocatorKey=mmap -Dfile.trades=<absolute path of trades.csv> -jar <absolute path of fat jar path>
```

### Running from the IDE

We provide two run configurations: `AtotiSpringBootApplication` and `AtotiSpringBootApplicationOTEL` for IntelliJ.

### Spring Boot Developer Tools

For development purposes, we recommend using the `spting-boot-devtools` module to enable live reload.

Add the following to the `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
        <optional>true</optional>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Create a run configuration with the following `Before launch` tasks:

![dev-tools-run-configuration](.github/assets/dev-tools-run-configuration.png)

> üí° **Note:** Developer tools are automatically disabled when running a fully packaged application. If your application is launched using java -jar or if it‚Äôs started using a special classloader, then it is considered a ‚Äúproduction application‚Äù. Flagging the dependency as optional in Maven or using compileOnly in Gradle is a best practice that prevents devtools from being transitively applied to other modules using your project.

### Connecting to the Atoti Server

- Excel: you can connect to the cube from Excel, by connecting to an 'Analysis Services' source. The default URL to use
  when running locally is `http://localhost:9090/xmla`

- AtotiUI, ActiveViam's user interface for exploring the cube, will be available from `http://localhost:9090/ui`

- List of REST endpoints provided can be found at `http://localhost:9090/swagger-ui/index.html`

The default security credentials are `admin:admin`, but can be modified in the `application.yml` file.<br>
For a real production deployment you should probably use LDAP instead of hardcoding the users in the `application.yml` file.<br>
It is also recommended that you change the JWT key pair in `application.yml` by running the class `JwtUtil` and
generating a new key pair.
